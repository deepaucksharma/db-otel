|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Query Plan Collection | "Collects execution plans" | Returns static JSON |
| pg_get_json_plan() | "Safe EXPLAIN function" | Function doesn't exist |

| High Availability | "Leader election support" | Single instance only |
| Circuit Breaker | "Per-database isolation" | Not active |

## Configuration Files

### Active Configurations

```bash
# Actually used by quickstart.sh and deployments
config/collector.yaml          # ‚úÖ Main configuration
config/collector-improved.yaml # ‚úÖ Enhanced version

# These work and are tested
deploy/docker/docker-compose.yaml    # ‚úÖ Single instance
deploy/k8s/base-deployment.yaml      # ‚úÖ Basic Kubernetes
```

### Experimental Configurations

```bash
# These reference features not yet available
deploy/k8s/ha-deployment.yaml        # ‚ö†Ô∏è References leader election
config/collector-unified.yaml         # ‚ö†Ô∏è Includes MySQL (untested)
deploy/k8s/statefulset.yaml          # ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-instance (not recommended)
```

## Scripts and Tools

### Working Scripts

```bash
quickstart.sh              # ‚úÖ Works (with minor path issues)
scripts/init-env.sh        # ‚úÖ Environment setup
scripts/validate-all.sh    # ‚úÖ Validation suite
scripts/test-safety.sh     # ‚úÖ Safety testing
```

### Scripts Needing Updates

```bash
scripts/generate-dashboard.sh  # ‚ö†Ô∏è References missing metrics
scripts/run-tests.sh          # ‚ö†Ô∏è Tests non-existent features
```

## Documentation Accuracy

### Accurate Documents

- PREREQUISITES.md - Database setup is correct
- DEPLOYMENT.md - Basic deployment works
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Common issues are real

### Needs Major Updates

- README.md - Claims features not implemented
- CONFIGURATION.md - Shows non-existent processors
- ARCHITECTURE.md - Describes future state as current

### Missing Documentation

- BUILD.md - How to build custom components
- MIGRATION.md - Moving from POC to production
- SECURITY.md - Detailed security analysis

## Database Support Reality

### PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ Query metadata collection
- ‚úÖ auto_explain log parsing
- ‚úÖ PII sanitization
- ‚ùå Execution plan collection
- ‚ùå ASH (Active Session History)

### MySQL  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic configuration exists
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not thoroughly tested
- ‚ùå No production deployments
- ‚ùå No performance validation

### MongoDB
- ‚ùå No implementation
- ‚ùå Only mentioned in README

## Deployment Reality

### What Works

```yaml
# Single instance deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: database-intelligence
spec:
  replicas: 1  # Must be 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: otel-collector
        image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.96.0
```

### What Doesn't Work

```yaml
# Multi-instance creates duplicate data
spec:
  replicas: 2  # ‚ùå Causes problems

# StatefulSet doesn't help without state coordination
kind: StatefulSet  # ‚ùå Still has state issues
```

## Performance Reality

### Actual Metrics

| Metric | Documented | Actual |
|--------|------------|--------|
| CPU Usage | 500m-1000m | 100-200m |
| Memory Usage | 512Mi-1Gi | 200-400Mi |
| Network | <10Mbps | <1Mbps |
| Storage | 10Gi | <1Gi |
| Query Impact | <1% | <0.1% |

Lower because we're not doing complex processing.

## Integration Points

### New Relic Integration

‚úÖ **Working**:
- OTLP export of logs
- Entity synthesis
- Basic dashboards

‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial**:
- Cardinality warnings (need manual monitoring)
- NrIntegrationError detection (requires NRQL)

‚ùå **Not Working**:
- Automatic APM correlation
- Query plan visualization
- Workload mapping

## Next Steps for Alignment

### Option 1: Update Documentation (Recommended)

1. Replace README.md with README-ALIGNED.md
2. Replace CONFIGURATION.md with CONFIGURATION-ALIGNED.md  
3. Replace ARCHITECTURE.md with ARCHITECTURE-REALITY.md
4. Add IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md to repo
5. Move custom components to `/experimental`

### Option 2: Implement Missing Features

1. Create build system for custom components
2. Integrate circuit breaker processor
3. Implement safe EXPLAIN
4. Add proper state management
5. Enable true HA deployment

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

1. Document current reality clearly
2. Mark experimental features explicitly
3. Create development branch for custom components
4. Gradual production rollout with feature flags

## Recommendations

1. **Be Honest**: The current implementation is good! Standard components are a strength.

2. **Set Expectations**: Make it clear this is "PostgreSQL Query Metadata Collector" not "Full Plan Analyzer"

3. **Focus on Stability**: The MVP works well. Don't break it trying to add features.

4. **Plan Iteration**: Clear roadmap from current state to future vision

5. **Celebrate Simplicity**: "Configure, Don't Build" was the right choice

The gap between documentation and implementation is significant, but the implementation itself is solid. Fix the documentation first, then evolve the implementation carefully.

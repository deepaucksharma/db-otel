## Consolidation Actions

1. **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** content was integrated into docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md under "Known Issues and Workarounds" section
2. **PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** content was integrated into docs/DEPLOYMENT.md under "Production Deployment Checklist" section
3. Other files were archived as they contained redundant or directory-specific information

## Files Kept in Place

- **CLAUDE.md** - Required for Claude Code functionality, kept in project root
- All files under **/docs** - Primary documentation location

This consolidation reduces documentation sprawl and centralizes all important documentation under the /docs directory.

## Quick Start

### For Operators
Start with [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) to understand current status and deployment options.

### For Developers
Read [TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_DEEPDIVE.md](./TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_DEEPDIVE.md) for code architecture details.

### For Architects
Review [UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md](./UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md) for complete system understanding.

### For Executives
See [FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md](./FINAL_COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md) for project status and recommendations.

## Key Findings

### ✅ What's Implemented
- 4 sophisticated custom processors (3,242 lines)
- Production-grade error handling
- Advanced features (auto-tuning, self-healing)
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

### ❌ What's Blocking Deployment
- Module path inconsistencies in build configs
- Incomplete custom OTLP exporter
- No integration tests (due to build issues)

### ⏱️ Time to Production
- **4-8 hours** of actual fixes needed
- **1-2 weeks** total including testing and validation

## Documentation Standards

All documentation in this directory:
- ✅ Validated against actual implementation
- ✅ Marks features as [DONE], [NOT DONE], or [PARTIALLY DONE]
- ✅ Includes working code examples
- ✅ Provides honest assessment of gaps
- ✅ Updated December 2024

## Archive

Previous documentation versions are archived in:
- `archive/redundant-20250629/` - Initial redundant files
- `archive/pre-validation-20241229/` - Pre-validation documentation

These archives are retained for historical reference but should not be used for implementation guidance.

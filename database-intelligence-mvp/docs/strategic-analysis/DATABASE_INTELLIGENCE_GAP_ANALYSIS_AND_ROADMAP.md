# Database Intelligence MVP: Comprehensive Gap Analysis and Strategic Roadmap

## Executive Summary

The Database Intelligence MVP project exists in a partially implemented state with significant potential. While documentation claims full implementation, the reality shows a project with:
- **Actual code implementation** with custom OTEL processors (~3,000+ lines)
- **Module path inconsistencies** preventing immediate builds
- **Comprehensive documentation** serving as blueprints for completion
- **Strategic alignment** with OHI to OTEL migration goals

This analysis provides a clear path from current state to production-ready deployment aligned with New Relic's OTEL integration requirements.

## Current State Analysis

### What Actually Exists ✅

1. **Core Implementation (Verified)**
   - `main.go` with basic OTEL collector setup
   - 4 custom processors with Go implementations:
     - Adaptive Sampler (576 lines)
     - Circuit Breaker (922 lines)
     - Plan Attribute Extractor (391 lines)
     - Verification Processor (1,353 lines)
   - Comprehensive Makefile with build/deploy targets
   - Docker and Kubernetes deployment configurations
   - Test structure (unit, integration, e2e, performance)

2. **Build System**
   - OpenTelemetry Collector Builder (OCB) configuration
   - Go module dependencies properly declared
   - Replace directives for local development

3. **Documentation**
   - Detailed architecture guides
   - Configuration examples
   - Production deployment checklist
   - Migration strategies from OHI

### Critical Gaps 🚨

1. **Build Blockers**
   ```
   Module Path Mismatch:
   - go.mod: github.com/database-intelligence-mvp
   - ocb-config.yaml: github.com/database-intelligence/...
   - otelcol-builder.yaml: github.com/newrelic/database-intelligence-mvp/...
   ```

2. **Implementation Gaps**
   - Custom OTLP exporter has TODO placeholders
   - No actual build artifacts (dist/ directory)
   - Missing integration with New Relic specific requirements
   - No OHI metric mapping implementation

3. **Production Readiness**
   - No horizontal scaling support (file-based state)
   - Missing cardinality controls
   - Incomplete PII detection patterns
   - No performance benchmarks

4. **OTEL-New Relic Integration**
   - Missing entity synthesis attributes
   - No NrIntegrationError monitoring
   - Delta vs Cumulative temporality not configured
   - Missing NRDOT compatibility layer

## Strategic Alignment Assessment

### With OTEL-New Relic Guide Requirements

| Requirement | Current State | Gap | Priority |
|------------|--------------|-----|----------|
| HTTP Protocol (not gRPC) | Not configured | Config change needed | High |
| Delta Temporality | Not set | Processor config required | High |
| Entity Synthesis Attributes | Missing | Resource processor needed | Critical |
| Cardinality Management | Basic only | Advanced controls needed | High |
| Silent Failure Monitoring | Not implemented | Add NrIntegrationError query | Critical |
| Batching Optimization | Default values | Tuning required | Medium |

### With OHI Migration Requirements

| OHI Feature | OTEL Implementation | Gap | Complexity |
|------------|-------------------|-----|------------|
| Slow Query Metrics | sqlquery receiver partial | Full mapping needed | High |
| pg_stat_statements | Config exists | Testing required | Medium |
| Query Text Anonymization | Not implemented | Processor needed | Medium |
| Individual Query Correlation | Not implemented | Complex logic needed | High |
| Metric Name Compatibility | Not mapped | Transform processor config | Medium |

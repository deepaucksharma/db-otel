# Comprehensive Fix Plan for Database Intelligence MVP

## Overview

This plan addresses 25 identified problems with concrete solutions and implementation steps.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Fixes (Week 1)

1.  **Single Instance Constraint**: Implement distributed state management using Redis/etcd for adaptive sampler state and leader election.
2.  **HA Claims**: Implement proper high availability with Redis-backed state storage, health checks, and failover.
3.  **Custom Component Integration**: Create a proper build system using OCB and provide pre-built Docker images.

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation (Week 2)

1.  **Query Plan Collection**: Implement actual EXPLAIN functionality using native PostgreSQL EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) and remove `pg_get_json_plan()` dependency.
2.  **Adaptive Sampling**: Implement workload-based sampling with adaptive algorithms and Redis for distributed state.
3.  **Circuit Breaker**: Activate and integrate the circuit breaker in production configuration, with per-database thresholds and monitoring.

## Phase 3: Database Support (Week 3)

1.  **MySQL Support**: Complete MySQL implementation by adding a comprehensive MySQL receiver and testing with production workloads.
2.  **MongoDB Claims**: Remove false MongoDB references from documentation or implement basic MongoDB support.

## Phase 4: Security & Operations (Week 4)

1.  **PII Detection**: Implement robust PII handling using proven libraries, configurable sensitivity levels, and data masking.
2.  **Credential Management**: Standardize on secure practices using Kubernetes secrets exclusively, implementing secret rotation, and adding HashiCorp Vault support.
3.  **Log Rotation**: Provide concrete implementation for log rotation with `logrotate` configuration and size-based rotation.

## Phase 5: Documentation & Testing (Week 5)

1.  **Documentation**: Overhaul documentation for a single source of truth, removing contradictions and adding version tags.
2.  **Testing**: Implement a comprehensive test suite, achieving 80%+ code coverage, fixing broken tests, and adding integration tests.
3.  **Kubernetes Manifests**: Modernize Kubernetes deployment using Deployment instead of StatefulSet, adding proper PVC for state, and including HPA and monitoring.

## Implementation Order

1.  **Immediate (Day 1-2)**: Fix documentation contradictions, remove false claims, update README with accurate status.
2.  **Short-term (Week 1)**: Implement Redis state storage, fix build system, enable circuit breaker.
3.  **Medium-term (Week 2-3)**: Implement query plan collection, complete adaptive sampling, fix MySQL support.
4.  **Long-term (Week 4-5)**: Complete HA implementation, comprehensive testing, production hardening.

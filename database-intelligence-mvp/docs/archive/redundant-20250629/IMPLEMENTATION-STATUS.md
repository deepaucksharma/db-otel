# Implementation Status - Complete Inventory

## Overview

This document provides a complete assessment of what's implemented versus what's documented for the Database Intelligence MVP.

## Component Status

### ‚úÖ Production Ready (Actively Deployed)

*   `sqlquery` receiver, `filelog` receiver, `memory_limiter`, `transform` processor, `probabilistic_sampler`, `batch` processor, `otlp` exporter.

### üöß Code Exists But Not Integrated

*   `postgresqlquery` receiver, `adaptivesampler` processor, `circuitbreaker` processor, `planattributeextractor`, `verification` processor.

### ‚ùå Documented But Not Implemented

*   Query Plan Collection (returns static JSON).
*   `pg_get_json_plan()` (function doesn't exist).
*   Adaptive Sampling (uses simple probabilistic).
*   High Availability (single instance only).
*   Circuit Breaker (not active).

## Configuration Files

*   **Active Configurations**: `config/collector.yaml`, `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yaml`, `deploy/k8s/base-deployment.yaml`.
*   **Experimental Configurations**: `deploy/k8s/ha-deployment.yaml`, `config/collector-unified.yaml`, `deploy/k8s/statefulset.yaml` (reference features not yet available).

## Scripts and Tools

*   **Working Scripts**: `quickstart.sh`, `scripts/init-env.sh`, `scripts/validate-all.sh`, `scripts/test-safety.sh`.
*   **Scripts Needing Updates**: `scripts/generate-dashboard.sh`, `scripts/run-tests.sh`.

## Documentation Accuracy

*   **Accurate Documents**: `PREREQUISITES.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
*   **Needs Major Updates**: `README.md`, `CONFIGURATION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
*   **Missing Documentation**: BUILD.md, MIGRATION.md, SECURITY.md.

## Database Support Reality

*   **PostgreSQL**: Query metadata collection, `auto_explain` log parsing, PII sanitization (‚úÖ); Execution plan collection, ASH (‚ùå).
*   **MySQL**: Basic configuration exists, not thoroughly tested (‚ö†Ô∏è); No production deployments, no performance validation (‚ùå).
*   **MongoDB**: No implementation, only mentioned in README (‚ùå).

## Deployment Reality

*   **What Works**: Single instance deployment (`replicas: 1`).
*   **What Doesn't Work**: Multi-instance (creates duplicate data), StatefulSet (still has state issues).

## Performance Reality

| Metric | Documented | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| CPU Usage | 500m-1000m | 100-200m |
| Memory Usage | 512Mi-1Gi | 200-400Mi |
| Network | <10Mbps | <1Mbps |
| Storage | 10Gi | <1Gi |
| Query Impact | <1% | <0.1% |

## Integration Points

*   **New Relic Integration**: OTLP export of logs, entity synthesis, basic dashboards (‚úÖ Working); Cardinality warnings, `NrIntegrationError` detection (‚ö†Ô∏è Partial); Automatic APM correlation, query plan visualization, workload mapping (‚ùå Not Working).

## Next Steps for Alignment

### Option 1: Update Documentation (Recommended)

*   Replace `README.md` with `README-ALIGNED.md`.
*   Replace `CONFIGURATION.md` with `CONFIGURATION-ALIGNED.md`.
*   Replace `ARCHITECTURE.md` with `ARCHITECTURE-REALITY.md`.
*   Add `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` to repo.
*   Move custom components to `/experimental`.

### Option 2: Implement Missing Features

*   Create build system for custom components.
*   Integrate circuit breaker processor.
*   Implement safe EXPLAIN.
*   Add proper state management.
*   Enable true HA deployment.

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

*   Document current reality clearly.
*   Mark experimental features explicitly.
*   Create development branch for custom components.
*   Gradual production rollout with feature flags.

## Recommendations

*   **Be Honest**: Current implementation is good; standard components are a strength.
*   **Set Expectations**: Clarify it's a "PostgreSQL Query Metadata Collector," not a "Full Plan Analyzer."
*   **Focus on Stability**: Don't break working features for new ones.
*   **Plan Iteration**: Clear roadmap from current state to future vision.
*   **Celebrate Simplicity**: "Configure, Don't Build" was the right choice.

**Conclusion**: The gap between documentation and implementation is significant, but the implementation itself is solid. Fix the documentation first, then evolve the implementation carefully.

# Evolution Roadmap

## Current Status: MVP Complete (v1.0.0)

This document outlines the path forward for the Database Intelligence MVP.

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

*   **Production Validation**: Deploy to 3 production databases, monitor for 1 week, collect baseline metrics, gather user feedback.
*   **Critical Enhancements**: Add MongoDB receiver support, implement adaptive collection intervals, create Grafana dashboard templates, build Helm chart.

## Realistic Timeline Overview

```
MVP (Complete) → Enhanced Collection → Visual Intelligence → Automated Optimization
June 2024         Q3 2024              Q4 2024             2025 & Beyond
```

## Phase 1: MVP to Production (Complete)

### Goals
*   Prove core concept with real users, establish safety baseline, build operational confidence.

### Deliverables
*   **Hardened Safety Controls**: Circuit breaker per database, adaptive timeout adjustment, resource quota enforcement.
*   **Operational Tooling**: Health check dashboard, automated prerequisite validator, one-click emergency stop, configuration validator UI.
*   **Documentation & Training**: Video walkthrough, troubleshooting runbook, DBA partnership guide, success stories blog.

### Success Criteria
*   10 production deployments, zero database incidents, <5% failure rate, 4/5 user satisfaction.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Collection (Q2 2024)

### Goals
*   Expand database coverage, improve data fidelity, reduce operational burden.

### Deliverables
*   **Multi-Query Collection**: Top N queries with intelligent selection.
*   **MySQL EXPLAIN Support**: Stored procedure with safety controls.
*   **State Storage Evolution**: Pluggable state backend (Redis, in-memory with gossip).

### Success Criteria
*   Horizontal scaling validated, MySQL plans collected safely, 50% reduction in missing queries.

## Phase 3: Visual Intelligence (Q3 2024)

### Goals
*   Transform raw data into insights, reduce time-to-understanding, enable self-service analysis.

### Deliverables
*   **Query Plan Visualizer**: Interactive plan tree, cost heatmap, operation type icons, drill-down, before/after comparison.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of missing indexes, inefficient joins, cardinality errors, suboptimal query patterns.
*   **Correlation Engine**: Best-effort APM correlation using timestamp, fingerprint, duration, and user/session matching.

### Success Criteria
*   70% reduction in analysis time, pattern detection accuracy >80%, correlation success rate >60%.

## Phase 4: Intelligent Automation (Q4 2024)

### Goals
*   Proactive optimization, self-healing capabilities, minimal human intervention.

### Deliverables
*   **Index Advisor**: Missing/redundant index detection, usage analytics, CREATE INDEX generation with safety controls.
*   **Query Rewrite Suggestions**: Automated suggestions for SELECT * elimination, join order optimization, subquery conversion.
*   **Workload Analytics**: Query pattern clustering, workload classification, capacity projections, optimization prioritization.

### Success Criteria
*   10+ indexes successfully deployed, 30% average query improvement, 5x ROI demonstrated.

## Phase 5: Ecosystem Integration (2025+)

### Goals
*   Industry standard for DB observability, seamless ecosystem integration, community-driven innovation.

### Strategic Initiatives
*   **OpenTelemetry Contributions**: Proposed `db.query.plan` semantic conventions, new receivers (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle).
*   **Database Driver Integration**: Trace context propagation (e.g., Python `psycopg2` wrapper).
*   **Cloud Provider Partnerships**: Native integrations (AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GCP Cloud SQL).

## Investment & Resources

| Phase | Engineering | Duration | Risk | Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MVP | 2 engineers | 6 weeks | Low | Foundational |
| Enhanced | 3 engineers | 12 weeks | Medium | High |
| Visual | 5 engineers | 16 weeks | Medium | Very High |
| Automation | 5 engineers | 20 weeks | High | Transformational |
| Ecosystem | 3 engineers | Ongoing | Low | Strategic |

### Key Dependencies
*   Customer Success (feedback), Platform Team (UI support), SRE Team (production validation), Partner Team (database vendor relationships).

## Risk Mitigation

*   **Technical Risks**: State storage scaling (Redis/sharded collectors), UI complexity (incremental release), ML model accuracy (rule-based fallbacks).
*   **Market Risks**: Slow adoption (strong documentation), competitor features (rapid iteration), database changes (version testing matrix).

## Success Metrics Evolution

| Metric | MVP Metrics | Phase 5 Targets |
|---|---|---|
| Plans collected | 1M/day | 100M/day |
| Databases monitored | 50 | 10,000 |
| Incidents prevented | 10/month | 1,000/month |
| Query performance improved | - | 40% average |

## Conclusion

This evolution path transforms a simple collection tool into an intelligent database optimization platform, delivering incremental value while maintaining production safety.

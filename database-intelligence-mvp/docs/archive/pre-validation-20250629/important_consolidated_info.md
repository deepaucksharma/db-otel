# Consolidated Important Information for Database Intelligence MVP

This document consolidates critical information from various project documentation, providing a concise overview of the project's vision, architecture, implementation status, and key considerations for ongoing development and operation.

## 1. Project Vision and Core Principles

The Database Intelligence MVP aims to be a production-ready database monitoring solution built on an **OTEL-First architecture**. Key principles include:
*   **Maximize Standard OpenTelemetry Components**: Utilize community-maintained components (90% of functionality) wherever possible to reduce custom code, improve maintainability, and leverage community support.
*   **Sophisticated Custom Processors**: Develop custom processors only for genuine OpenTelemetry gaps (e.g., advanced sampling, database-specific protection, plan analysis, data quality validation).
*   **Safety First**: Prioritize protecting monitored databases through features like read-replica enforcement, query timeouts, connection limits, and PII sanitization.
*   **Configure, Don't Build**: Emphasize configuration over custom development, leading to simplified setup and maintenance.
*   **Zero Lock-in**: Ensure compatibility with any OTEL-compatible backend.

### Key Metrics of Change (Post-OTEL-First Transformation)

**Complexity Reduction**
*   Configuration Files: 17 → 3 (82% reduction)
*   Custom Go Code: 15K → 3K (80% reduction)
*   Documentation Files: 61 → 15 (75% reduction)
*   Build Time: 5min → 30s (90% reduction)
*   Deployment Time: 30min → 5min (83% reduction)

**Resource Efficiency**
*   CPU Usage: 500-1000m → 100-200m (80% reduction)

*   Simple, clear architecture
*   Easy to maintain
*   Full community support

## 2. Architecture Overview

The system supports two primary operational modes:

### 2.1. Standard Mode (Production-Ready)
Relies on battle-tested OpenTelemetry components for stability and low resource usage (e.g., `postgresql` receiver, `mysql` receiver, `sqlqueryreceiver`, `memorylimiterprocessor`, `transformprocessor`, `otlpexporter`). It supports High Availability (HA) through leader election.

### 2.2. Experimental Mode (Advanced Features)
Incorporates sophisticated custom Go components for advanced capabilities like Active Session History (ASH) sampling, intelligent adaptive sampling, a database-aware circuit breaker, query plan attribute extraction, and comprehensive data quality verification. This mode typically requires a custom collector build and may have higher resource usage.

### 2.3. Evolution Path
The project envisions an evolution from MVP to Enhanced Collection, Visual Intelligence, and Automated Optimization, including future OpenTelemetry contributions and cloud provider partnerships.

## 3. Key Features and Capabilities

The Database Intelligence MVP provides:
*   **Comprehensive Metrics Collection**: PostgreSQL and MySQL metrics (CPU, memory, connections, locks, query performance, wait events, replication lag) collected as dimensional OpenTelemetry metrics.
*   **PII Sanitization**: Sensitive data (emails, credit cards, SSNs, SQL literals) is sanitized using the `transformprocessor`.
*   **Intelligent Sampling**: The **Adaptive Sampler** (Production Ready) adjusts rates based on query cost, error rate, or volume, while probabilistic sampling (standard) provides fixed-rate reduction.
*   **Database Protection**: The **Circuit Breaker** (Production Ready) prevents monitoring overload on databases with per-database protection and adaptive timeouts.
*   **Query Plan Analysis**: The **Plan Attribute Extractor** (Functional) parses PostgreSQL JSON execution plans and extracts MySQL Performance Schema metadata, generating plan hashes and derived attributes.
*   **Data Quality Validation**: The **Verification Processor** (Most Sophisticated) provides comprehensive data quality validation, advanced PII detection, health monitoring, auto-tuning, and self-healing capabilities.
*   **High Availability (HA)**: Standard mode supports HA with leader election. Stateful custom components (Adaptive Sampler, Circuit Breaker) are designed for persistent state management.
*   **New Relic Integration**: Optimized OTLP export, entity synthesis, and cardinality management. Critical to monitor `NrIntegrationError` for silent failures.

*   **Limited MongoDB Support**: MongoDB support is largely non-existent.

### 4.3. Key Challenges and Ongoing Efforts
*   **Documentation Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across all documentation as the project evolves and new features are implemented.
*   **External State Management**: While custom processors are production-ready, ensuring robust external state management for all stateful components across various deployment scenarios is an ongoing effort.
*   **Upstream Contributions**: Identifying and refining generic components for potential contribution to `opentelemetry-collector-contrib`.
*   **Automated Rollback**: Further development of automated rollback capabilities for critical issues.

## 5. Configuration and Deployment

### 5.1. Simplified Configuration
The project has consolidated from 15+ configuration files to a core set of 3:
*   `config/collector.yaml`: Main production configuration.
*   `config/collector-dev.yaml`: Development-friendly configuration with debug output.
*   `config/examples/minimal.yaml`: A simple starting point.
Environment variables are used for sensitive data and dynamic settings.

### 5.2. Deployment Options
*   **Docker Compose**: Ideal for local development and testing.
*   **Kubernetes**: Recommended for production environments, supporting HA and auto-scaling.
*   **Systemd**: For traditional server deployments.
*   **Container Platforms**: Guides for AWS ECS and Google Cloud Run are available.

## 6. Operational Aspects

### 6.1. Monitoring the Collector
*   **Health Checks**: `http://localhost:13133/health` (standard), `http://localhost:13134/health` (experimental).
*   **Metrics**: `http://localhost:8888/metrics` (standard), `http://localhost:8889/metrics` (experimental).
*   **Logging**: Configurable levels (info, debug) and output paths.
*   **Key Metrics to Monitor**: `otelcol_process_memory_rss`, `otelcol_processor_refused_metric_points`, `otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points`, `circuit_breaker_state`.

### 6.2. Security Considerations
*   **Credentials**: Use environment variables or secrets management (Kubernetes secrets, Docker secrets). Never hardcode.
*   **Database Access**: Employ read-only monitoring users with minimal privileges.
*   **Network Security**: Utilize TLS for all connections, implement network policies/firewall rules.
*   **PII Sanitization**: Ensure `transformprocessor` is active and patterns are effective.

### 6.3. Troubleshooting
Common issues include collector startup failures, database connection problems, missing metrics, high memory usage, export failures, and circuit breaker issues. Debug mode and detailed logs are essential for diagnosis.

## 7. Migration and Evolution

### 7.1. Migration from Custom Components
The project provides guidance for migrating from older custom implementations to standard OpenTelemetry components, emphasizing the use of standard receivers (`postgresql`, `sqlquery`), `transformprocessor` for PII, and `probabilisticsampler`. Custom processors should only be retained for true OTEL gaps.

### 7.2. Future Roadmap
The long-term vision includes multi-query collection, MySQL EXPLAIN support, external state storage (Redis), visual plan analysis, automated optimization recommendations (index advisor, query rewrite), and deeper ecosystem integration (OpenTelemetry contributions, driver integration, cloud partnerships).

The project's evolution path is envisioned in several phases:

*   **Enhanced Collection**: Expand database coverage (e.g., MongoDB), improve data fidelity (e.g., multi-query collection), and reduce operational burden. This phase also includes state storage evolution (e.g., pluggable state backend like Redis).
*   **Visual Intelligence**: Transform raw data into actionable insights, reduce time-to-understanding, and enable self-service analysis. Deliverables include query plan visualizers, pattern recognition for inefficiencies, and a correlation engine for APM integration.
*   **Intelligent Automation**: Focus on proactive optimization, self-healing capabilities, minimal human intervention. This phase aims to deliver an Index Advisor, Query Rewrite Suggestions, and Workload Analytics.
*   **Ecosystem Integration**: Establish the project as an industry standard for database observability, with seamless ecosystem integration and community-driven innovation. This includes OpenTelemetry contributions (e.g., new semantic conventions, receivers), database driver integration for trace context propagation, and cloud provider partnerships.

This evolution path transforms the project into an intelligent database optimization platform, delivering incremental value while maintaining production safety.

## 8. Critical Recommendations for Moving Forward

To enhance the project's robustness, maintainability, and alignment with OpenTelemetry best practices:

1.  **Refine Custom Exporters/Extensions**: Replace custom `otlp_enhanced` exporter and custom `healthcheck` extension with standard contrib components, moving transformations to processors.
2.  **Decompose Monolithic Components**: Further refactor any remaining monolithic custom components (e.g., `postgresqlquery` receiver if still in use) to separate ingestion from processing logic, leveraging standard `postgresqlreceiver` and `sqlqueryreceiver`.
3.  **Improve Database Support**: Fully integrate and test `mysqlreceiver` and explore `mongodbreceiver` from contrib.
4.  **Align Documentation with Reality**: Conduct a comprehensive overhaul of all `.md` files to accurately reflect the current implementation status, feature availability, and architectural decisions.
5.  **Enhance Testing**: Ensure robust unit and integration tests cover all features, especially refactored and stateful components.
6.  **Explore Upstream Contributions**: Identify and refine generic components for potential contribution to `opentelemetry-collector-contrib`.

## 9. Known Limitations and Considerations

While the Database Intelligence MVP is production-ready and highly capable, it's important to be aware of the following limitations and considerations:

*   **Limited Automatic APM Correlation**: The collector cannot automatically link database queries to APM traces due to the lack of trace context propagation in current database drivers/engines. Manual correlation is currently required.
*   **Limited MySQL Execution Plan Support**: Safe real-time execution plan collection for MySQL is challenging due to the lack of statement-level timeouts and the potential risks of `EXPLAIN` operations on primary databases.
*   **PII Detection Imperfections**: While advanced regex-based PII detection is implemented, it is inherently imperfect and may not catch all sensitive data. Additional safeguards (e.g., network isolation, encryption) are recommended.
*   **Database Prerequisites**: Deployment often requires significant database configuration (e.g., `pg_stat_statements`, Performance Schema), which may necessitate DBA involvement.
*   **Resource Scaling**: Memory usage can grow with database activity, which may limit practical throughput in extremely high-volume scenarios.
*   **Query Visibility and Privacy**: Collecting full query text, even with PII scrubbing, raises privacy concerns. Consider query allowlists and data retention limits.
*   **Collection Latency**: The monitoring is not real-time; collection intervals can range from seconds to minutes, making it unsuitable for sub-second issue detection. It is primarily designed for trend analysis and identifying longer-term performance issues.
*   **Sampling Accuracy**: Statistical sampling, even adaptive, may occasionally miss rare or intermittent issues. Combining with other monitoring approaches can provide a more complete picture.
*   **Plan Format Variations**: Database execution plan formats can vary significantly across database versions and configurations, requiring best-effort parsing and potentially manual analysis for complex cases.
*   **Dashboard Capabilities for Plans**: Visual analysis of raw JSON plans in observability platforms can be limited. Future enhancements aim to improve visual plan analysis.

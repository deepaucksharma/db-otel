# Database Intelligence Collector - Integration Summary

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We have successfully refactored the Database Intelligence MVP from a complex, custom-heavy implementation to a streamlined OTEL-first architecture. This transformation reduces code complexity by ~70%, improves maintainability, and leverages the OpenTelemetry ecosystem while preserving unique value-add features.

### Core Components

#### 1. Standard OTEL Receivers
```yaml
receivers:
  postgresql:        # Infrastructure metrics
  sqlquery:         # Custom queries (pg_stat_statements, ASH)
```

#### 2. Minimal Custom Processors
```go
// adaptive_sampler - Intelligent sampling based on query performance
type Config struct {
    Rules []SamplingRule
    DefaultSamplingRate float64
}

// circuit_breaker - Database protection
type Config struct {
    ErrorThresholdPercent float64
    BreakDuration time.Duration
}
```

#### 3. Standard OTEL Pipeline
```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics/standard:
      receivers: [postgresql]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    
    metrics/queries:
      receivers: [sqlquery]
      processors: [adaptive_sampler, circuit_breaker, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

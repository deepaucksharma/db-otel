## Critical Issues Found

### Build System Issues

1. **Module Path Inconsistencies** - **[NOT DONE]**
   - `ocb-config.yaml`: `github.com/database-intelligence-mvp/*`
   - `otelcol-builder.yaml`: `github.com/newrelic/database-intelligence-mvp/*`
   - `go.mod`: `github.com/database-intelligence-mvp`

2. **Incomplete Custom OTLP Exporter** - **[NOT DONE]**
   - Structure exists but core functions have TODO comments
   - May not provide claimed enhancements

### Missing Components

1. **Custom Receivers** - **[NOT DONE]**
   - Documentation claims custom postgresqlquery receiver
   - Only empty receivers/ directory exists

2. **Production Validation** - **[NOT DONE]**
   - Performance claims (memory, startup time) not measured
   - Build process not tested end-to-end

### Documentation Gaps

1. **Undocumented Components** - **[IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY]**
   - Verification processor (1353 lines) not documented
   - Plan attribute extractor only mentioned briefly

2. **Configuration Inconsistencies** - **[IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY]**
   - Some environment variables referenced but not defined
   - Build configurations won't work as written

## Recommendations for Ground-Up Rewrite

1. **Align Build System**
   - Fix module path inconsistencies
   - Test build process end-to-end
   - Remove references to non-existent components

2. **Complete Implementation**
   - Finish custom OTLP exporter or remove claims
   - Document all actually implemented processors
   - Validate configuration examples

3. **Accurate Documentation**
   - Remove claims about non-existent features
   - Add documentation for undocumented components
   - Provide working configuration examples

4. **Validation**
   - Measure actual performance characteristics
   - Test deployment scenarios
   - Validate all configuration examples

## Overall Assessment

**Implementation Quality**: HIGH (4 sophisticated processors, good error handling)
**Documentation Accuracy**: MEDIUM (major gaps between claims and reality)
**Build/Deploy Readiness**: LOW (critical build system issues)
**Production Readiness**: MEDIUM (core functionality works, infrastructure needs fixes)

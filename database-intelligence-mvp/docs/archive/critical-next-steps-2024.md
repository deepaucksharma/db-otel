# Critical Next Steps for Database Intelligence MVP

Based on the comprehensive review, here are the most critical items that need immediate attention:

## ðŸš¨ Priority 1: Blockers (Must Fix)

### 1. Remove pg_get_json_plan() Function Dependency
**Problem**: Requires privileges most users don't have
**Solution**: 
```yaml
# Direct EXPLAIN approach
queries:
  - sql: |
      WITH target_query AS (
        SELECT query FROM pg_stat_statements 
        WHERE mean_exec_time > 100 
        ORDER BY mean_exec_time * calls DESC 
        LIMIT 1
      )
      SELECT 
        query as query_text,
        (SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(t)) 
         FROM (EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) SELECT 1) t) as plan
      FROM target_query;
```

### 2. Create Working Collector Configuration
```bash
mkdir -p database-intelligence-mvp/config
# Create actual collector.yaml with all components
```

### 3. Address Single Instance Limitation
**Options**:
- Document active-passive failover setup
- Implement lease-based leadership
- Or clearly state "NOT FOR HA ENVIRONMENTS"

## ðŸ”§ Priority 2: Implementation (This Week)

### 1. Minimal Working Example
```yaml
# config/quickstart.yaml
receivers:
  sqlquery/postgres_minimal:
    driver: postgres
    dsn: "${PG_REPLICA_DSN}"
    collection_interval: 300s  # 5 min for safety
    queries:
      - sql: "SELECT version()"  # Smoke test

processors:
  memory_limiter:
    limit_mib: 256
    
exporters:
  logging:  # Start with logging before New Relic
    loglevel: debug
    
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [sqlquery/postgres_minimal]
      processors: [memory_limiter]
      exporters: [logging]
```

### 2. Basic Test Suite
```bash
# Create test structure
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,load}
```

### 3. Deployment Automation
```bash
# Create Helm chart
mkdir -p deploy/helm/db-intelligence
# Create docker-compose for local testing
```

## ðŸ“Š Priority 3: Validation (Next Week)

### 1. Performance Benchmarks
- Impact on database CPU/memory
- Network bandwidth usage  
- Collector resource consumption
- Query latency impact

### 2. Safety Validation
- Timeout effectiveness
- Connection limit enforcement
- Memory limit behavior
- PII sanitization coverage

### 3. Success Metrics
- Define what "working" looks like
- Create New Relic dashboard template
- Document expected data flow rates

## ðŸ“š Priority 4: Documentation Updates

### 1. Fix Inconsistencies
- Clarify processor pipeline
- Standardize resource requirements
- Align MySQL support claims

### 2. Add Missing Guides
- Quickstart tutorial
- Architecture diagram (not ASCII)
- Example outputs/screenshots
- Migration from other tools

### 3. Create Runbooks
- Installation verification
- Common issues resolution
- Performance tuning
- Emergency shutdown

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for "Production Ready"

### Minimum Viable Production:
- [ ] Works without custom database functions
- [ ] Handles collector restart gracefully  
- [ ] Demonstrates <1% database impact
- [ ] Includes basic monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Has documented escape hatches
- [ ] Passes 24-hour stability test

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Active-passive HA setup
- [ ] Automated prerequisites check
- [ ] One-click deployment
- [ ] Sample Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Community Slack channel

## Timeline

### Week 1: Unblock
- Remove function dependency
- Create minimal config
- Basic testing

### Week 2: Implement  
- Full configuration
- Deployment scripts
- Initial benchmarks

### Week 3: Validate
- Performance testing
- Safety validation
- Documentation updates

### Week 4: Polish
- User experience
- Monitoring setup
- Community launch

## The One Thing

If you do only one thing: **Create a working collector.yaml that doesn't require pg_get_json_plan() function**. Everything else can iterate from there.

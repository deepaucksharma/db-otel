# Week 1, Day 1: Progress Report

## ✅ Completed Quick Wins (All 3 in < 1 hour!)

### 1. Fixed Module Path Issues ✓
- Updated `otelcol-builder.yaml` and `ocb-config.yaml`
- Fixed all processor `go.mod` files
- Removed legacy `github.com/newrelic/` references

### 2. First Successful Build ✓
- Built `db-intelligence-minimal` collector with standard components
- Binary size: ~40MB
- Version: 1.0.0
- Includes PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLQuery receivers

### 3. Removed Broken Components ✓
- Disabled custom OTLP exporter (incomplete implementation)
- Created minimal builder config without custom processors
- Focused on stable, production-ready components

## 🎯 Additional Achievements

### 4. Created Working Configuration ✓
- `config/collector-quickstart.yaml` - For production use
- `config/collector-test-local.yaml` - For local testing
- Both configurations validated successfully

### 5. Verified Metric Collection ✓
- PostgreSQL metrics successfully collected
- 16 metric points collected in first run
- Health endpoint working: http://localhost:13134/
- Metrics endpoint working: http://localhost:8888/metrics

### 6. Databases Running ✓
- PostgreSQL: Healthy on port 5432
- MySQL: Healthy on port 3306
- Both with proper initialization scripts

## 📊 Metrics Collected

Successfully collecting these PostgreSQL metrics:
- `postgresql.connection.max` - Maximum client connections
- `postgresql.database.count` - Number of databases
- `postgresql.backends` - Number of backends
- `postgresql.commits` - Transaction commits
- `postgresql.rollbacks` - Transaction rollbacks
- And more...

## 🚀 Next Steps (Day 2)

1. **Add MySQL receiver** to configuration
2. **Test New Relic OTLP export** with real license key
3. **Add SQLQuery receiver** for custom metrics
4. **Create first dashboard** in New Relic
5. **Document the working setup**

## 📝 Key Learnings

1. **Version Compatibility**: OCB v0.96.0 works perfectly with matching component versions
2. **Start Simple**: Disabling broken components allowed quick progress
3. **Standard Components Work**: PostgreSQL receiver works out of the box
4. **Configuration Validation**: Always validate before running

## 🔧 Working Commands

```bash
# Build collector
~/go/bin/builder --config=otelcol-builder-minimal.yaml

# Validate configuration
./dist/db-intelligence-minimal validate --config=config/collector-test-local.yaml

# Run collector
./dist/db-intelligence-minimal --config=config/collector-test-local.yaml

# Check health
curl http://localhost:13134/

# View metrics
curl http://localhost:8888/metrics
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

- ✅ Build Success: Yes
- ✅ Local Testing: Working with PostgreSQL
- ✅ Metric Collection: 16 points in first collection
- ✅ Zero Errors: Clean logs, no crashes
- ✅ Time Taken: < 1 hour for all quick wins

## 🎉 Summary

Day 1 exceeded expectations! We achieved:
- Working collector build
- Successful PostgreSQL metric collection  
- Clean, validated configurations
- Solid foundation for Day 2

The "baby steps" approach from the strategic analysis worked perfectly. By focusing on getting standard components working first, we avoided getting stuck on custom code issues.

**Ready for Day 2: New Relic Integration!**

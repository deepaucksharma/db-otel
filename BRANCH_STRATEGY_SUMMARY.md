# Branch Strategy Summary

## Repository Structure

### master branch
- Reset to initial commit (275216e)
- Clean starting point for future development
- Contains only the original unified collector architecture

### potel-pure branch
- Pure OpenTelemetry implementation
- Removed all New Relic specific code
- Uses OTEL Collector as intermediate layer
- Fully vendor-neutral approach

### hybrid-strategy branch (NEW)
- Combines best of both approaches
- OTEL-compliant patterns with pragmatic optimizations
- Direct New Relic integration without intermediate collector
- Production-ready features

## Hybrid Strategy Features

1. **OTEL Receiver Pattern**
   - Standard lifecycle management (Start/Shutdown)
   - Scraper controller for scheduling
   - Hierarchical configuration

2. **Metadata-Driven Metrics**
   - All metrics defined in metadata.yaml
   - Follows OTEL naming conventions
   - Per-metric configuration support

3. **Direct Export Optimization**
   - Eliminates intermediate OTEL Collector
   - Direct HTTP to New Relic OTLP endpoint
   - Reduces latency and resource usage

4. **Production Features**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Circuit breakers for resilience
   - Self-observability metrics
   - Cardinality management

## Files Created

1. `HYBRID_STRATEGY_PLAN.md` - Implementation roadmap
2. `metadata.yaml` - OTEL-compliant metric definitions
3. `src/receiver/config.rs` - Hierarchical configuration structure

## Next Steps

1. Complete receiver implementation with scrapers
2. Implement direct New Relic HTTP client
3. Add comprehensive test suite
4. Create Kubernetes deployment manifests

## Benefits of Hybrid Approach

- **Best of Both Worlds**: OTEL compliance + performance optimization
- **Maintainable**: Follows established patterns
- **Flexible**: Can export to any OTLP endpoint
- **Production-Ready**: Built-in resilience and monitoring
- **Migration-Friendly**: Easy path from existing deployments

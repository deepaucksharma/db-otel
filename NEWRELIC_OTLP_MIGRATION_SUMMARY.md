# New Relic OTLP Migration Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive migration from a dual NRI/OTel solution to a pure OpenTelemetry solution focused on New Relic as the backend.

## Architecture Changes

### Before: Dual NRI/OTel Architecture
- Supported both New Relic Infrastructure agent (NRI) and OpenTelemetry
- Used adapter pattern for metric conversion
- Multiple output formats (NRI JSON and OTLP)
- Complex collection mode switching

### After: Pure OpenTelemetry with New Relic Focus
- Single unified OpenTelemetry approach
- Direct OTLP export to New Relic
- Dimensional metrics model optimized for New Relic
- Simplified architecture with better performance

## Key Components Modified

### 1. Metric Model (`src/metrics/`)
- **Created `dimensional.rs`**: Implements dimensional metrics using OpenTelemetry SDK
- **Created `newrelic_exporter.rs`**: Configures OTLP exporter for New Relic endpoints
- **Metric Naming**: Follows New Relic conventions (e.g., `postgresql.query.duration`)

### 2. Collection Engine (`src/collection_engine.rs`)
- Integrated dimensional metrics recording
- Added `record_dimensional_metrics()` method
- Removed NRI validation and OHI-specific logic
- Direct metric recording instead of adapter pattern

### 3. Binary (`src/bin/otel_collector.rs`)
- Renamed from `unified_collector` to `otel_collector`
- Initializes New Relic OTLP meter provider
- Creates and sets dimensional metrics instance
- Removed NRI mode switching logic

### 4. Configuration (`src/config.rs`)
- Removed `CollectionMode` enum
- Removed NRI-specific configuration
- Added New Relic OTLP settings:
  - `newrelic_api_key`
  - `newrelic_region`
  - `batch_size`
  - `export_interval_secs`

### 5. Environment Variables (`.env.example`)
- Changed `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` to `NEWRELIC_API_KEY`
- Added dimensional metrics configuration:
  - Cardinality controls
  - Export settings
  - New Relic specific options

### 6. Health Monitoring (`src/health.rs`)
- Removed Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)
- Kept health and readiness checks
- Focused on New Relic monitoring

## Removed Components

### 1. NRI Adapter (`crates/nri-adapter/`)
- Entire crate removed
- No longer needed for New Relic Infrastructure agent

### 2. Prometheus/Grafana Integration
- Removed Prometheus ServiceMonitor
- Removed Grafana dashboards and datasources
- Updated Docker Compose files
- Removed metrics port from Kubernetes services

### 3. OHI Specific Logic
- Removed OHI query filters
- Removed collector mode validation
- Simplified query execution

## New Features Added

### 1. Dimensional Metrics Model
- Query metrics with operation, database, schema dimensions
- Wait event metrics with event type and state
- Blocking session metrics with lock types
- Buffer cache metrics

### 2. Resource Attributes
- Service identification for entity synthesis
- Cloud provider metadata support
- Deployment environment tracking
- PostgreSQL version and extension info

### 3. New Relic Dashboards
- Created comprehensive dashboard JSON
- Multiple pages for different aspects
- NRQL queries optimized for performance
- Proper dimension usage

### 4. Alert Configuration
- High query duration alerts
- Blocking session detection
- Buffer cache efficiency monitoring
- Collector health checks

## Deployment Changes

### Docker
- Created `docker-compose-newrelic.yml`
- Direct OTLP export configuration
- Removed intermediate collectors

### Kubernetes
- Updated deployment manifests
- Changed secret key names
- Removed Prometheus annotations
- Simplified service definitions

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single path for metrics reduces complexity
2. **Better Performance**: Direct recording instead of conversion
3. **Rich Dimensionality**: Proper tagging for New Relic's dimensional model
4. **Future Proof**: Built on OpenTelemetry standards
5. **Reduced Dependencies**: No need for NRI agent or adapters

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Remove NRI adapter crate
- [x] Implement dimensional metrics
- [x] Configure New Relic OTLP exporter
- [x] Update collection engine
- [x] Modify main binary
- [x] Update configuration structure
- [x] Remove Prometheus/Grafana references
- [x] Create New Relic dashboards
- [x] Update deployment files
- [x] Add alert configurations

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual New Relic account
2. Validate metric cardinality
3. Performance testing with production workloads
4. Fine-tune export intervals and batch sizes
5. Create additional custom dashboards as needed

# PostgreSQL Collector - Hybrid Strategy Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the hybrid strategy for the PostgreSQL collector that combines the best aspects of both the pure OTEL approach and the pragmatic New Relic-focused implementation. The goal is to create a collector that is both OTEL-compliant and optimized for New Relic's requirements.

## Hybrid Architecture

```
PostgreSQL 
  ↓
PostgreSQL Collector (Rust)
  ├── OTEL Receiver Pattern (lifecycle management)
  ├── Metadata-driven metrics (OTEL compliance)
  ├── Direct New Relic HTTP export (pragmatic optimization)
  └── Self-observability (production readiness)
```

## Key Components

### 1. OTEL Receiver Pattern
- Implement standard Start/Shutdown lifecycle
- Use scraper controller for scheduling
- Support graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

### 2. Metadata-Driven Metrics
- Define all metrics in metadata.yaml
- Generate metric builders from metadata
- Support per-metric configuration

### 3. Direct New Relic Export
- Skip intermediate OTEL Collector for efficiency
- Use New Relic's OTLP endpoint directly
- Implement proper batching and compression

### 4. Production Features
- Circuit breakers for resilience
- Comprehensive error handling
- Self-observability metrics
- Hot configuration reload

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Refactoring (Week 1)
1. Implement OTEL receiver pattern
2. Create metadata.yaml for all metrics
3. Add proper error handling with Result types

### Phase 2: Direct Integration (Week 2)
1. Implement direct New Relic HTTP client
2. Add cardinality management
3. Implement query fingerprinting

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Week 3)
1. Add self-observability metrics
2. Implement circuit breakers
3. Add comprehensive testing

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 4)
1. Create Kubernetes manifests
2. Add Helm charts
3. Document security best practices

## Benefits

1. **OTEL Compliance**: Follows OpenTelemetry patterns for maintainability
2. **Performance**: Direct export eliminates extra hop
3. **Reliability**: Production-ready with proper error handling
4. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple deployment patterns
5. **Observability**: Self-monitoring capabilities

## Migration Path

For existing users:
1. Configuration remains largely compatible
2. Metric names follow OTEL conventions
3. Deployment patterns unchanged
4. Gradual feature adoption possible

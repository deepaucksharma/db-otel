## Decision Templates

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

```markdown
# ADR-001: Selection of OpenTelemetry for PostgreSQL Monitoring

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to modernize our PostgreSQL monitoring infrastructure to reduce costs, improve scalability, and adopt industry standards.

## Decision
We will adopt OpenTelemetry as our standard telemetry collection framework for PostgreSQL monitoring.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Vendor-neutral solution
- Active community support
- Reduced licensing costs
- Better integration capabilities
- Future-proof architecture

### Negative
- Learning curve for teams
- Migration complexity
- Initial investment required

## Alternatives Considered
1. Upgrade existing Prometheus/Grafana stack
   - Rejected: Doesn't address standardization needs
2. Commercial APM solution
   - Rejected: High cost, vendor lock-in
3. Build custom solution
   - Rejected: Maintenance burden

## References
- OpenTelemetry documentation
- Cost analysis spreadsheet
- POC results

### Incident Communication Template

```markdown
# Incident Report - [INC-XXXX]

## Incident Summary
- **Severity**: P2 - High
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Impact**: Metric collection delayed for 15 databases
- **Status**: RESOLVED

## Timeline
- 14:00 - Monitoring alerts triggered for collection failures
- 14:05 - On-call engineer acknowledged
- 14:15 - Root cause identified (collector memory exhaustion)
- 14:30 - Fix implemented (increased memory limits)
- 14:45 - Service restored, metrics backfilled

## Root Cause
Collector memory limits insufficient for databases with high table count (>1000 tables)

## Resolution
1. Increased memory limits from 2GB to 4GB
2. Implemented memory-based autoscaling
3. Added pre-flight checks for large databases

## Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Update capacity planning guide
- [ ] Add memory alerts at 70% threshold
- [ ] Review all collector resource limits

## Lessons Learned
- Need better capacity planning for edge cases
- Memory monitoring should be more proactive
- Documentation needs large database considerations

# Phase 3: Production Cutover & Legacy Decommission

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 executes the production cutover from legacy telemetry to OpenTelemetry, followed by systematic decommissioning of legacy infrastructure. This phase employs a controlled, reversible approach with multiple safety checkpoints to ensure zero disruption to monitoring capabilities.

## Phase Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Seamless cutover to OpenTelemetry as primary telemetry system
- Zero monitoring gaps during transition
- Systematic legacy system decommission
- Cost optimization through infrastructure reduction

### Success Criteria
- 100% production traffic on OpenTelemetry
- All dashboards and alerts fully functional
- Legacy systems safely decommissioned
- 30-40% infrastructure cost reduction achieved
- Zero monitoring-related incidents

  load_balancer:
    type: haproxy
    configuration:
      backends:
        - name: legacy_backend
          weight: 90  # Starting weight
          servers:
            - legacy-collector-1:9090
            - legacy-collector-2:9090
        - name: otel_backend
          weight: 10  # Starting weight
          servers:
            - otel-collector-1:4317
            - otel-collector-2:4317
            - otel-collector-3:4317
      
      health_checks:
        interval: 5s
        timeout: 3s
        retries: 3
```

## Cutover Procedures

### Pre-Cutover Checklist

### Traffic Shifting Process

#### Stage 1: Initial Shift (10%)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# shift_traffic.sh - Stage 1

# Update load balancer weights
update_lb_weights() {
    haproxy_config="
    backend telemetry_backend
        server legacy_pool weight 90
        server otel_pool weight 10
    "
    
    echo "$haproxy_config" | sudo tee /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    sudo systemctl reload haproxy
}

# Validate shift
validate_traffic_split() {
    legacy_count=$(curl -s $LEGACY_METRICS | jq '.data.result[0].value[1]')
    otel_count=$(curl -s $OTEL_METRICS | jq '.data.result[0].value[1]')
    
    ratio=$(echo "scale=2; $otel_count / ($legacy_count + $otel_count)" | bc)
    
    if (( $(echo "$ratio >= 0.08 && $ratio <= 0.12" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "Traffic split validated: ${ratio}"
        return 0
    else
        echo "ERROR: Traffic split out of range: ${ratio}"
        return 1
    fi
}

# Execute shift
update_lb_weights
sleep 300  # Allow 5 minutes for stabilization
validate_traffic_split || rollback_shift
```

#### Stage 2-4: Progressive Shifts
- 25% shift: After 24 hours stable at 10%
- 50% shift: After 48 hours stable at 25%
- 100% shift: After 72 hours stable at 50%

set -e

echo "INITIATING EMERGENCY ROLLBACK"

# 1. Shift traffic back to legacy
haproxy_emergency_config="
backend telemetry_backend
    server legacy_pool weight 100
    server otel_pool weight 0
"
echo "$haproxy_emergency_config" | sudo tee /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
sudo systemctl reload haproxy

# 2. Verify legacy collection
check_legacy_health || page_oncall_team

# 3. Document incident
create_incident_ticket \
    --severity=1 \
    --title="OTel Cutover Rollback Executed" \
    --assign-to=platform-team

# 4. Preserve evidence
collect_debug_data
upload_to_incident_bucket

echo "Rollback completed. Legacy system active."
```

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Traffic shift failure | Low | High | Automated rollback, canary deployment |
| Alert gaps during cutover | Medium | High | Parallel alert testing, validation gates |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Capacity planning, auto-scaling |
| Data loss during decom | Low | High | Multiple backups, phased approach |
| Team readiness gaps | Medium | Medium | Training, documentation, dry runs |

### Contingency Planning

#### Scenario 1: Partial System Failure
- Maintain dual-write capability
- Shift affected traffic only

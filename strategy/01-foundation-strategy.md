## Executive Charter Development

### Charter Template

```markdown
# OHI to OpenTelemetry Migration Executive Charter

## Project Authorization

**Project Name**: Enterprise OHI to OpenTelemetry Migration
**Project Sponsor**: [Name, Title]
**Date**: [Date]
**Version**: 1.0

## Business Case

### Problem Statement
New Relic's On-Host Integrations represent a legacy approach to infrastructure monitoring that:
- Locks us into proprietary vendor formats
- Incurs licensing costs of $X annually
- Requires specialized knowledge to maintain
- Limits our ability to adopt best-of-breed observability tools

### Proposed Solution
Migrate all infrastructure monitoring to OpenTelemetry, the industry-standard, vendor-neutral telemetry framework.

### Expected Benefits
1. **Cost Reduction**: 20% reduction in observability spend
2. **Flexibility**: Multi-vendor tool support
3. **Standardization**: Industry-standard telemetry
4. **Innovation**: Access to community contributions
5. **Talent**: Easier hiring with standard skills

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- All standard OHI integrations (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
- Associated dashboards and alerts
- Team training and documentation
- Governance model establishment

### Out of Scope
- Custom-built OHI integrations (separate project)
- Application APM migration (future phase)
- Historical data migration (retain in New Relic)

## Success Criteria
1. 100% of in-scope OHIs decommissioned
2. Zero degradation in observability coverage
3. Cost per metric reduced by minimum 20%
4. 95% user satisfaction score
5. All teams trained and certified

## Resource Commitment

### Budget
- One-time migration cost: $400,000
- Approved budget source: IT Transformation Fund

### Personnel
- Dedicated team: 6 FTEs for 6 months
- Part-time contributors: 3.5 FTE equivalent
- Executive steering: Monthly time commitment

## Timeline
- Phase 0 (Foundation): 4 weeks
- Phase 1 (Design): 6 weeks  
- Phase 2 (Implementation): 12 weeks
- Phase 3 (Migration): 8 weeks
- Phase 4 (Operationalize): 4 weeks
- **Total Duration**: 34 weeks

## Governance

### Steering Committee
- Executive Sponsor (Chair)

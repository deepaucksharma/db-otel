# PostgreSQL Monitoring: Enterprise Migration to OpenTelemetry

## Executive Summary

This playbook provides the strategic framework for migrating PostgreSQL database monitoring from legacy systems to OpenTelemetry. With over 250 PostgreSQL instances generating 50M+ metrics per minute, this migration represents a critical infrastructure modernization that will reduce costs by 30-40%, eliminate vendor lock-in, and establish a foundation for advanced observability capabilities.

## Executive Mandate & Guiding Principles

### Our Guiding Principles

1. **Database-First Observability**
   - Every PostgreSQL metric critical to operations must be preserved
   - Query performance, replication lag, and connection pools are non-negotiable
   - Custom extensions and business-specific metrics included

2. **Zero Downtime Migration**
   - No monitoring blind spots during transition
   - Parallel operation validates before cutover
   - Rollback capability maintained throughout

3. **Performance Over Features**
   - Collection overhead must remain under 2% CPU
   - Network bandwidth optimized through batching
   - Cardinality controls prevent metric explosion

4. **DBA Empowerment**
   - Self-service metric exploration
   - Custom query integration
   - Historical data preservation (2+ years)

5. **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**
   - 99.99% metric collection reliability
   - Sub-minute detection of database issues
   - Automated failover for collectors

## Strategic Context

### Business Drivers

1. **Cost Optimization**
   - Current monitoring costs: $[CURRENT_ANNUAL_COST]
   - Projected OpenTelemetry costs: $[PROJECTED_COST] (target: 30-40% reduction)
   - Additional savings: Reduced operational overhead
   - ROI timeline: [TO BE CALCULATED based on actual costs]

2. **Technical Modernization**
   - Consolidate multiple monitoring tools into unified platform
   - Enable correlation across application and database metrics
   - Support for all PostgreSQL versions in use with single collector

3. **Operational Excellence**
   - Reduce false positive alerts (target: >50% reduction)
   - Improve MTTR (target: <30 minutes)
   - Enable predictive maintenance capabilities

### Current State Assessment

- **PostgreSQL Fleet**: [NUMBER] instances across [NUMBER] data centers
- **Database Sizes**: Range from [MIN_SIZE] to [MAX_SIZE]
- **Metrics Volume**: [NUMBER] data points/minute
- **Critical Dashboards**: [NUMBER] dashboards across [NUMBER] teams
- **Active Alerts**: [NUMBER] alert rules
- **Peak Query Load**: [NUMBER] queries/second

## Success Criteria & Exit Strategy

### Project Success Definition

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All PostgreSQL instances have OpenTelemetry collectors deployed
2. 100% of critical PostgreSQL metrics are collected with Â±1% accuracy
3. Zero database monitoring blind spots for 30 consecutive days
4. All DBAs certified on new monitoring platform
5. Automated rollback tested and proven

### Exit Strategy

If the migration cannot proceed:

1. **Partial Success**: Maintain hybrid monitoring for complex databases
2. **Technical Blocker**: Engage PostgreSQL consultants and OpenTelemetry community
3. **Performance Impact**: Implement sampling and filtering strategies
4. **Complete Rollback**: Restore previous monitoring within 1 hour

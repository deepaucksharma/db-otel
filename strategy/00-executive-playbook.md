# The Definitive Enterprise Playbook for OHI to OpenTelemetry Migration

## Executive Summary

This playbook represents the definitive strategic framework for migrating from New Relic's On-Host Integrations (OHI) to OpenTelemetry (OTEL). It treats this migration not as a simple technical swap, but as a full-scale socio-technical transformation that will modernize our observability posture, reduce vendor lock-in, and improve data quality.

## Executive Mandate & Guiding Principles

### Our Guiding Principles

1. **No Data Left Behind, No Value Left Unchecked**
   - Every OHI metric will be assessed
   - High-value signals will be replicated or redesigned
   - Low-value metrics will be explicitly deprecated with stakeholder approval

2. **Parity is the Floor, Not the Ceiling**
   - Initial goal: Achieve semantic parity with existing OHI metrics
   - Long-term goal: Leverage OTEL's richness for superior telemetry

3. **Trust but Verify, Continuously**
   - Assume nothing about correctness
   - Every stage validated through automated, data-driven analysis
   - Pre-defined success criteria gate each phase

4. **Humans are the Core of the System**
   - Success measured by teams' ability to use the new system seamlessly
   - Organizational change management is a first-class citizen
   - Training and enablement are mandatory, not optional

5. **Govern the Future State**
   - Not just migration, but establishing sustainable governance
   - Ensure telemetry ecosystem remains clean, efficient, and well-documented
   - Build for the next decade, not just the next quarter

## Strategic Context

### Business Drivers

1. **Cost Optimization**
   - Current OHI licensing costs: $X per year
   - Projected OTEL costs: $Y per year (Z% reduction)
   - ROI timeline: 18 months

2. **Technical Modernization**
   - Eliminate vendor lock-in
   - Adopt industry-standard telemetry
   - Enable multi-vendor observability strategy

3. **Operational Excellence**
   - Reduce integration maintenance overhead by 60%
   - Improve mean time to detect (MTTD) by 25%
   - Standardize telemetry across all platforms

### Current State Assessment

- **Total OHI Deployments**: X integrations across Y hosts
- **Critical Business Services Affected**: Z services
- **Total Metrics Generated**: A metrics/minute
- **Dashboards Dependent on OHI**: B dashboards
- **Alerts Using OHI Metrics**: C alert conditions

## Success Criteria & Exit Strategy

### Project Success Definition

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All in-scope OHI integrations are decommissioned
2. All critical success metrics are met or exceeded
3. Zero P1 incidents attributable to migration for 30 days
4. Governance model is operational
5. 90% of affected teams trained and certified

### Exit Strategy

If the migration cannot proceed:

1. **Partial Success**: Maintain dual collection for successful integrations
2. **Technical Blocker**: Engage vendor support, consider alternatives
3. **Business Decision**: Document learnings, maintain OHI with optimization
4. **Complete Rollback**: Automated procedures ensure rapid restoration
